# VocPrez-theme-gsq
A VocPrez UI theme for the [Geological Survey of Queensland](https://www.business.qld.gov.au/industries/mining-energy-water/resources/geoscience-information/gsq).

### Applying the theming
`apply.py` adds these elements - templates, style files and endpoints additions - to a VocPrez instance. The only variable that needs setting is `VOCPREZ_HOME` at line 20, in `apply.py`.

### Install log
`install.log` records informally, not using a build too, the installation steps for VocPrez. Note that there are variations on this procedure that are simpler for automated build, such as using Docker as per [VocPrez' Docker instructions](https://github.com/RDFLib/VocPrez/#running-in-docker).
